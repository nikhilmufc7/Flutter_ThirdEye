# Flutter : Third Eye


## Idea

ThirdEye: A Cross platform flutter app that involves Tensorflow Lite , Firebase, Some Custom Data Sets , Optical Character Recognition and text to Speech which reads data from any form of text and outputs it in form of speech for persons with visual impairment. We are using some custom tflite models to also detect objects and motions sensors for sensing in realtime. 

## Inspiration
We were really inspired by Vikas's talk in the conference where he talked about bringing accessibility to Hackerrank. Our core idea is to help visually impaired people get a sense of their surroundings and also nearby places and give them ability to listen to any sort of paper with written information on it. So then, may it be a newspaper , a pamplet , a brochure or any written notes. We also tried to integrate Google Assistant to make it as seemless as it could be but due to time constraints and inexperience with the platform we were unable to do it but that is something we look forward to working on.

## Tech Stack
